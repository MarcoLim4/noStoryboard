# noStoryboard

Exercise reading top 100 Albums from Apple. No storyboards or NIBs used.

- This was the first time ever, I had to do a project competly not using Storyboards or NIBs;


# Some Details


- I started usign lazy vars in the begining but decided to make functions to return labels where I pass some parameters. That made code a little more clear to read;
- I've added a couple of helper classes, but as requested, no PODs or 3rd party Libs. 
- Works on both light and dark mode but I did not focus very much in UI details as I'm sure we can implenent the any design we want (given we have the design details)


# LaunchScree SB still there

- I had some issues removing the LaunchScreen storyboard from the project. By removing it, I noticed the main screen was not showing properly inside the proper frame. 
- So... I kept the LaunchScreen.storyboard but I did not touch anything there.
